/* For this project, I downloaded spotify data from kaggle.com*/
/* Next, I created a table for inserting the spotify data.*/
/* Lastly I performed analytics from the data using SQL*/

/*Table Creation*/
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

/*After creating the table I inserted the Spotify data. csv into the table*/

/*Then, I created/explored the data using the following SQL.*/


#1) First, I found out the average popularity, energy, danceability, and the duration of songs of the artist & track.

SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(duration_ms)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#2) Next, I made a query to see which artist/s were on this table frequently

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS artist_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY artist_count DESC;

#3) Lastly, I determined who were the top 15 artists based off of popularity

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 15;
